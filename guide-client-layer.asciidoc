= Client Layer

There are various technical approaches to build GUI clients. The OASP proposes rich clients that connect to the server via data-oriented services (e.g. using REST with JSON).
In general, we have to distinguish among the following types of clients:

* web clients
* native desktop clients
* (native) mobile clients

Currently, we focus on web-clients. So far we offered a responsive Java Script based client provided by OASP4js that integrates seamlessly with OASP-server. A separate guide is provided for https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js[oasp4js].

== JavaScript for Java Developers

In order to get started with client development as a Java developer we give you some hints to get started. Also if you are an experienced JavaScript developer and want to learn Java this can be helpful. First, you need to understand that the JavaScript ecosystem is as large as the Java ecosystem and developing a modern web client requires a lot of knowledge. The following table helps you as experienced developer to get an overview of the tools, configuration-files, and other related aspects from the new world to learn. Also it helps you to map concepts between the ecosystems. Please note that we list the tools recommended by OASP here (and we know that there are alternatives not listed here such as gradle, grunt, bower, etc.).
